Note: 
habit from previous job - no commens just try to make the code fluent to be self documenting

Issue: 
For some reason I couldn't get my VS2022 to properly setup a solution with multiple projects
As a consequence I have the tests as part of the unique project and
The second test client application (windows .net Core UI) in another project

Got my token from git repository and tested that that api works OK
Adapted my Models definitions to match the incoming data (name wise)
Setup the remote call (to github) to use my token in the project (appsetings.json).
Did the coding of the whole projected.
Used DependencyInjection where it was posible.


Further development:
I got the API calls working 
I added an echotest api to use as a ping
I implemened the dpendency injection of the settings from appsettings.json (added in an Utils folder)

I created Unit Tests for bot Controllers but for some reason I couldn't run them
They compile OK but don't run
Web search came up with some specific sugestions which I applied but no luck

Created a Windows App to be used as a test client in a second project and for it
It had to be developed in a separate project as my VS2022 was fussy about multiple projects
It has an installer so one can just install it and use it as a client to hit the new api

Everything is now in the provided file.
